# grokr [UNSAFE current implementation results in ban]
grokr enables Grok on [X](https://x.com) to be integrated as a search engine for [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/). 

This repo contains an example config as `example-config.py` demonstrating how to configure the search engine and a greasemonkey script in `grokr.js` to extract params set via `example-config.py`.
